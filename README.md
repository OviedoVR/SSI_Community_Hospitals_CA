**1.** Additional costs to the hospital,<br> **2.** Longer patient staying time,<br>
**3.** Unexpected readimissions,<br> **4.** Deaths.<br> Thus, preventing or reducing SSI plays 
a great role in healthcare facilities. <br><br>Considering a **benchmark of 3\%** for **SSI**,
could you quickly get those facilities performing bad (SSI > benchmark)? 

With this *Streamlit app* you could do that by procedure category and procedure type.
